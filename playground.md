# My Neural Network Assignment

## Experiment 1: Understanding XOR

I experimented with the Neural Network Playground to understand how neural networks can learn the XOR pattern.

Task 1: \\
The model as given combines our two input features into a single neuron.
Will this model learn any nonlinearities? Run it to confirm your guess.\\
As it is selected, the activation is Linear, the training_loss = 0.49, and Test_Loss = 0.5 \\ So there is no no nonliniarity learning.

Task 2: \\ 
Increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer from 1 to 2, and also try changing from a Linear activation to a nonlinear activation like ReLU. Can you create a model that can learn nonlinearities? Can it model the data effectively? \\
\\
it changed from a linear to a nionlinear but it does not represent the nonlinearity completely and correctly.
