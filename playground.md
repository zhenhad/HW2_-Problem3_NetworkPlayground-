# My Neural Network Assignment

## Experiment 1: Understanding XOR

I experimented with the Neural Network Playground to understand how neural networks can learn the XOR pattern.

Task 1:\\
The model as given combines our two input features into a single neuron.
Will this model learn any nonlinearities? Run it to confirm your guess.
